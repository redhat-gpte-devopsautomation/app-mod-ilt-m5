= Adding Event Streaming capabilities to an application

== Introduction

To support the business requirement of capturing and processing user activity on the Globex Coolstuff application, two new services have been developed:

* *Activity Tracking service*: This service exposes a REST endpoint. User activities on the Globex website (such as opening a product page, liking a product etc..) generates an activity payload which is sent to the Activity Tracking REST endpoint. The service transforms this payload into a Kafka message which is sent to a topic on the Kafka broker.
* *Recommendation Engine*: This service consumes and processes the events produced by the Activity Tracking service. The service uses the Kafka Streams library to continuously determine the top featured products (the products which generate the most activities).
The service also exposes a REST endpoint to expose the list of featured products.

Both services are developed using Quarkus, the Quarkus extensions for reactive messaging and Kafka Streams. The development of the services is outside the scope of this workshop, but you are encouraged to examine the source code of the applications on GitHub: link:https://github.com/cloud-services-summit-connect-2022/activity-tracking-service[Activity Tracking Service,role=external,window=_blank] and link:https://github.com/cloud-services-summit-connect-2022/recommendation-engine[Recommendation Engine,role=external,window=_blank]

[#event-goals]
== Goals of this lab

In this part of the workshop you will connect the Activity Tracking and Recommendation Engine applications to the OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka instance using link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.10/applications/connecting_applications_to_services/understanding-service-binding-operator.html[Service Binding,role=external,window=_blank].

You will be using the Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console and the OpenShift Developer Console to setup and configure the Streams for Apache Kafka instance as well as the service binding. Note that these steps can also be achieved using the Red Hat OpenShift Application Services (`rhoas`) CLI.

== Step-By-Step Instructions

=== Explore the environment

. In a browser window, navigate to the console of the lab OpenShift cluster at link:https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/topology/ns/globex-%USERID%?view=graph[console^,role=external,window=openshiftconsole]. Login with your username and password (`%USERID%/openshift`). Open the *Developer* perspective in the *globex-%USERID%* namespace.
. In the Developer perspective, open the *Topology* view. Expect to see something like this (rearrange the topology as you see fit):
+
image::globex-deployment-topology.png[]
+
The deployed topology consists of:
+
** `globex-ui`: The Globex Coolstuff web application (Node.js/Angular). 
** `catalog-app`: The Globex Coolstuff catalog service, consisting of the catalog database and the Spring Boot catalog microservice.
** `inventory-app`: The Globex Coolstuff inventory service, consisting of the inventory database and the Quarkus inventory microservice.
** `activity-tracking`: The Activity Tracking service. Notice that the deployment of the service is scaled to zero. The service will be scaled up once the connection to the Kafka broker is set up.
**  `recommendation-engine`: The Recommendation Engine service. Notice that the deployment of the service is scaled to zero. The service will be scaled up once the connection to the Kafka broker is set up.
** `order-placement-service`: The Order Placement service, which receives orders from the web application through REST and sends the orders to a Kafka topic. Notice that the deployment of the service is scaled to zero. The service will be scaled up once the connection to the Kafka broker is set up.
** `activity-tracking-simulator`: A Quarkus service that simulates user activity events and sends them to the Activity Tracking service.
. Open the *Globex UI* application in a browser tab. To do so, click on the image:console-open-url.png[Open URL, 30, 30] icon next to the blue circle representing the *Globex UI* deployment.

=== Binding applications to Streams for Apache Kafka

Binding applications to services using Service Binding requires the Service Binding operator to be installed on the OpenShift cluster. To bind more specifically to a OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka instance, the Red Hat OpenShift Application Services (RHOAS) operator is required. Both operators have been installed on your OpenShift cluster.

==== [underline]#*Connect OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka*#

In this part of the workshop you connect your OpenShift instance to the Streams for Kafka instance you created previously. This can be done from the Developer perspective on the OpenShift console, or using the `rhoas` CLI. In this workshop you use the OpenShift console.

. In a browser window, navigate to the console of your OpenShift cluster at link:https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/topology/ns/globex-%USERID%?view=graph[OpenShift Console^,role=external,window=openshiftconsole]. Ensure you are in the *Developer* perspective in the *globex-%USERID%* namespace.
. In the Developer perspective, navigate to the *+Add* view. Locate the *Developer Catalog* card with the *Managed Services* entry
+
image::openshift-console-developer-catalog.png[]
. Click the *Managed Services* link. This opens the Managed Services page, which has a card for *Red Hat OpenShift Application Services*.
+
image::openshift-console-application-services.png[]
. In order to discover the managed services you are entitled to, you need to unlock the functionality with a token obtained from link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com,role=external,window=redhatconsole]. +
Open a new browser tab and navigate to link:https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token[console.redhat.com/openshift/token,role=external,window=_blank_]. You should already be logged in, but if not, login with the Red Hat account ID you created or used earlier in the workshop. +
Click on *Load token* in the *Connect with offline token* box. Copy the generated API token.
. Go back to the browser tab with the OpenShift console, and click the *Red Hat OpenShift Application Services* card. This opens a popup window.  Paste the API token value in the *API Token* field.
+
image::openshift-console-application-services-popup.png[]
+
Click *Connect*. 
+
[NOTE]
====
After clicking *Connect*, the connect button turns grey, but the *Red Hat OpenShift Application Services* window stays open until the discovery of the available managed services is complete. This can take up to a minute. Do not close the *Red Hat OpenShift Application Services* window or refresh your browser in the meantime, as this will interrupt the process and lead to errors afterwards.
====
+
Once the discovery is done, you are redirected back to the *Managed Services* page, which now shows a card for *Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka*.
+
image::openshift-console-rhosak.png[]
. Click the *Red Hat OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka* card, and click *Connect*. This opens a page which shows the Kafka instances that you can connect to. Select the `globex` instance and click *Next*
+
image::openshift-console-rhosak-connect.png[]
. You are redirected to the *Topology View* of the Developer perspective, which shows now an icon for the managed Kafka instance.
+
image::openshift-console-topology-rhosak.png[]
. The entry is backed by a `KafkaConnection` custom resource created by the OpenShift Application Services operator. To see the details of the KafkaConnection resource, click on the resource in the Topology view, and in the Details window, select *Edit KafkaConnection* from the *Action* drop-down box to see the YAML structure of the custom resource. +
Notice that the YAML structure contains the bootstrap URL of the Kafka broker, as well as a reference to a secret containing the details of a service account, named `rh-cloud-services-service-account`. More specifically, look for the `status.bootstrapServerHost` and `status.serviceAccountSecretName` fields in the YAML descriptor. +
Click *Cancel* to return to the Topology view.

==== [underline]#*Set Permissions for a Service Account*#

As part of connecting to the managed Kafka instance, a service account is created. This is the service account that will be used by the Activity Tracking and Recommendation Engine services to actually connect to the managed Kafka instance. To make this work, the service account needs permissions, in particular the service account needs to be able to consume from topics, produce to topics and create new topics.

Setting permissions in the Access Control List of a Streams for Apache Kafka can be done in the link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com,role=external,window=redhatconsole] console, or using the `rhoas` CLI. In this workshop we use the UI on link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com,role=external,window=redhatconsole].

. Navigate to the *Application and Data Services* page of the link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com,role=external,window=redhatconsole] console.
. On the *Service Accounts* page, check that a service account was created by the OpenShift Application Services operator. Look for a service account with a name like `rhoas-operator-xxx`.
. Navigate to the *Streams for Apache Kafka -> Kafka instances* page and open the page for your Kafka instance.
. Click the *Access* tab to view the current ACL for this instance.
+
image::rhosak-default-access.png[]

. Click *Manage access*, use the *Account* drop-down menu to select the service account that was created by the OpenShift Application Services operator, and click *Next*.

. To set the permissions for this service account, under *Assign Permissions*, click the arrow of the *Add Permission* drop-down box. This opens a window with *Task-based permission*.
+
image::rhosak-manage-access-add-permission.png[] 
+
Select the *Consume from a topic* and *Produce to a topic* from the *Task-based permission* possibilities. Set the topic and consumer group names to `is` and `*`.
+
image::rhosak-manage-access.png[]
+
Click *Save*.
+
The ACL list for the service account should look like:
+
image::rhosak-access-serviceaccount.png[]

==== [underline]#*Bind applications to Streams for Apache Kafka*#

You can now bind the Activity Tracking Service and Recommendation Engine to the OpenShift Streams for Apache instance. Through Service Binding the connection details are injected into the application pods. Service Binding to a managed Kafka instance can be done on the Topology view of OpenShift console, or through the `rhoas` CLI. In this workshop we use the OpenShift console.

. In a browser window, navigate to the Topology view of your OpenShift cluster at link:https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/topology/ns/globex-%USERID%?view=graph[OpenShift Console^,role=external,window=openshiftconsole]. 
. Hover over the *activity-tracking* deployment, and grab the arrow that appears. Drag the arrow to the *KafkaConnection* icon. When reaching the KafkaConnection icon, a text box `Create Service Binding` appears. Release the arrow. Click *Create* in the *Create Service Binding* pop-up window. The Activity Tracking deployment and the KafkaConnection icon are now connected with a solid black arrow.
+
image::rhosak-service-binding.png[]
. Click on the *activity-tracking* deployment to open the details window, and click on the deployment name (above the Details, Resources and Observe tabs) to open the full details of the Deployment. Scroll down to the *Volumes* section. Notice that the service binding occurs by injecting a secret into the pod:
+
image::service-binding-secret.png[]
+
Go back to the Topology view.
. Scale the *activity-tracking* deployment to 1 replica. You can do so by clicking on the *activity-tracking* deployment, and in the details window select the *Details* tab, and click the arrow next to the circle to scale the deployment.
+
image::openshift-console-scale-deployment.png[]
. Check the logs of the activity-tracking pod, and notice that the pod successfully connects to the Kafka broker instance. +
To see the logs, click the *Resources* tab of the deployment, and click on the *View logs* link. +
Expect to see something like: 
+

----
. Go back to the Topology view, and repeat the same steps to bind the *recommendation-engine* deployment to the OpenShift Streams for Apache instance. Once the service binding created, scale the deployment to 1 pod.
. Once the recommendation-engine is up and running, check in the link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com,role=external,window=redhatconsole] console that a number of new topics have been created:
+
image::rhosak-kafka-streams-topics.png[]
+
Those are the topics created by the Kafka Streams topology in the Recommendation Engine to calculate the top featured products based on activity events.

=== Testing the Globex Coolstuff application

Now that the Activity Tracking and Recommendation Engine apps are up and running, we can test the generation of activity events and the calculation of the top featured products.

The deployment topology for the workshop includes an activity simulator service which will generate a number of activity events randomly distributed over a list of products. These activity events are sent to the Activity Tracking service and transformed into Kafka messages in the `globex.tracking` topic. These messages are consumed by the Recommendation Engine app to calculate the top featured products.

. In a browser window, navigate to the Topology view of the lab's OpenShift cluster at link:https://console-openshift-console.%SUBDOMAIN%/topology/ns/globex-%USERID%?view=graph[OpenShift Console^,role=external,window=openshiftconsole]. 
. Open the URL to the *activity-tracking-simulator* application by clicking the image:console-open-url.png[30,30] icon next to the blue circle representing the *activity-tracking-simulator* deployment. Navigate to the `q/swagger-ui` path of the application. 
+
Alternatively, open a browser tab and navigate to link:https://activity-tracking-simulator-globex-%USERID%.%SUBDOMAIN%/q/swagger-ui[Activity Tracking Simulator, role=external,window=activity-tracking-simulator].
. This opens a Swagger UI page which allows you to use the REST API of the application. The REST application has only one operation, `POST /simulate`.
+
image::activity-tracking-simulator-swagger-ui.png[]
. Generate a number of activity events. Click the *Try it out* button, and set `count` to any value between 100 and 1000. Click *Execute*.
. OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka has a message viewer functionality that allows you to inspect the contents of messages in a topic. +
Navigate to the to the *Application and Data Services -> Streams for Apache Kafka -> Kafka instances* page of link:https://console.redhat.com[console.redhat.com,role=external,window=redhatconsole], select your Kafka instance and on the instance page select the *Topics* tab. Click on the `globex.tracking` topic, and select the *Messages* tab. Notice the activity event messages, with a JSON payload:
+
image::rhosak-messages-tracking.png[]
. The featured product list calculated by the Recommendation Engine is produced to the `globex.recommendation-product-score-aggregated-changelog` topic. The list is recalculated roughly every 10 seconds as long as activity events are produced. Every calculation produces a message to the changelog topic. The last message in the topic represents the latest top featured list.
+
image::rhosak-messages-aggregated-changelog.png[]
. In a browser window, navigate to the home page of the Globex Coolstuff web application. Notice that the home page now shows a list of featured products.
+
image::globex-coolstuff-home-page-featured.png[]
+
Also, the product page now shows a banner with the featured products.
+
image::globex-coolstuff-product-page-featured.png[]

Congratulations! You reached the end of this part of the workshop, in which you added event streaming capabilities to the Globex Coolstuff application, using the OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka managed cloud service, and Service Binding to connect your apps to the Kafka instance.
